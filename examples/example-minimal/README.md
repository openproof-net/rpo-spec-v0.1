# RPO Minimal Example

This directory contains a minimal, valid RPO (Rapport Probatoire Ouvert) example for implementers and auditors.

## Files

- **rpo.json** — Machine-readable signed evidence bundle (placeholder for now)
- **rpo.pdf** — Human-readable narrative PDF (placeholder for now)
- **README.md** — Description of this example

## Purpose

This minimal example demonstrates:

- how a basic RPO is structured,
- how JSON and PDF relate to each other,
- how evidence, metadata, and signature anchors are organized.

More complete examples will be added in future versions.
