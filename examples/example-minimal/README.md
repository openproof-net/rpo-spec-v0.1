# RPO Minimal Example

This directory contains a minimal, valid example of an RPO (Rapport Probatoire Ouvert)
evidence bundle.  
It is designed to illustrate the basic structure required for implementers,
auditors, and verifiers.

## Files

- **rpo.json** — minimal machine-readable RPO bundle  
- **rpo.pdf.txt** — placeholder human-readable narrative (used before PDF generation)  
- **README.md** — description of this example

## Purpose

This minimal example demonstrates:

- how the RPO JSON bundle is structured,
- how the narrative (PDF) is linked to the JSON,
- how metadata is represented,
- how timestamps and hashes are integrated,
- how a verifier can read both the structured bundle and the human-readable narrative.

## Notes

- The content is intentionally simple.  
- Hashes are placeholders.  
- The purpose is to help developers and auditors understand the RPO format before
working with real cases or full bundles.
