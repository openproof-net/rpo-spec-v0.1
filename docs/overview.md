# OpenProof RPO — Documentation Overview

This directory contains the human-readable documentation of the RPO (Rapport Probatoire Ouvert) specification.

## Purpose

RPO defines an open, verifiable standard for digital evidence that combines:

- **Signed JSON**: structured and machine-readable data
- **Human-readable PDF**: coherent, interpretable narrative output
- **Public hash**: integrity anchor for audit and verification

The documentation explains how the RPO works, how it should be implemented, and how verification is performed.

## Structure

This `docs/` directory will include:

- `overview.md` — You are here
- `governance.md` — Governance, versioning, and consortium rules
- `verification.md` — How the registry and public hash checks work
- `pdf-guidelines.md` — Rules for the narrative PDF format
- `json-guidelines.md` — Requirements for the JSON structure

## Audience

This documentation is intended for:

- developers integrating RPO,
- legal and institutional partners,
- researchers in digital evidence and probatory systems,
- organizations wishing to verify or issue RPO-compliant reports.

More sections will be added as the specification evolves.
