# Legal Proceedings Profile

The Legal Proceedings profile configures OpenProof RPO 
for adversarial and procedural environments.

It is designed for contexts where evidence may be contested,
scrutinized, and formally challenged before an authority.

---

## Purpose

This profile enhances procedural clarity, 
traceability, and interpretive transparency.

It does not determine truth.
It structures coherence.

---

## Activation Context

The Legal Proceedings profile is intended for:

- Judicial litigation
- Administrative disputes
- Regulatory investigations
- Internal disciplinary hearings
- Arbitration procedures

---

## Configuration Parameters

When activated, this profile:

- Strengthens timestamp verification requirements
- Elevates chain-of-custody documentation
- Requires explicit uncertainty logging
- Highlights narrative contradictions
- Increases interpretive transparency markers

---

## Evidentiary Safeguards

Under this profile:

- All transformations must remain reversible
- Interpretive layers must be distinguishable from raw evidence
- Confidence indicators must be explicitly quantified
- Human review must remain visible and documented

---

## Architectural Principle

The RPO standard remains structurally identical.

This profile adjusts contextual emphasis,
not evidentiary ontology.

Proof remains:

- Structured
- Verifiable
- Transparent
- Contestable
