# OpenProof Profiles

Profiles define contextual activation logic for the RPO standard.
The standard itself remains neutral and invariant.
On the public interface, profiles are presented as decision contexts.

OpenProof Profiles define contextual activation parameters 
of the RPO standard.

The standard itself remains neutral and unique.

Profiles do not modify the structure of the RPO.
They configure how components are emphasized 
depending on institutional context.

## Architectural Principle

One standard.  
Multiple interpretive configurations.

not the nature of the proof infrastructure.
