# OpenProof Profiles

OpenProof Profiles define contextual activation parameters 
of the RPO standard.

The standard itself remains neutral and unique.

Profiles do not modify the structure of the RPO.
They configure how components are emphasized 
depending on institutional context.

## Available Profiles

- Governance
- Legal Proceedings (coming)
- Institutional Crisis (coming)

---

## Architectural Principle

One standard.  
Multiple interpretive configurations.

Profiles adjust weighting and activation logic,
not the nature of the proof infrastructure.
