# Institutional Crisis Profile

The Institutional Crisis profile configures OpenProof RPO 
for environments characterized by structural instability,
narrative fragmentation, or systemic distrust.

This profile does not presume misconduct.
It strengthens structural visibility.

---

## Purpose

This profile enhances the detection of:

- Narrative inconsistencies
- Decision asymmetries
- Procedural opacity
- Recurrent pattern distortions

It does not identify culpability.
It structures interpretive coherence under stress.

---

## Activation Context

The Institutional Crisis profile is intended for:

- Organizational governance breakdowns
- Public institutional controversies
- Escalating internal conflicts
- Whistleblower environments
- High-trust erosion contexts

---

## Configuration Parameters

When activated, this profile:

- Elevates pattern-recognition sensitivity
- Flags repetition loops and narrative inversions
- Requires expanded uncertainty logging
- Increases cross-document relational mapping
- Highlights temporal discontinuities

---

## Structural Safeguards

Under this profile:

- Interpretive inferences must remain explicitly marked
- Probabilistic indicators must be separated from factual layers
- No structural pattern may be labeled as intent
- Human oversight must remain documented

---

## Architectural Principle

Institutional instability amplifies interpretive noise.

The role of RPO under crisis conditions is not to decide,
but to stabilize coherence under stress.

Proof remains:

- Structured
- Traceable
- Context-aware
- Contestable
