# Institutional Crisis Profile

The Institutional Crisis profile configures OpenProof RPO 
for environments characterized by structural instability,
narrative fragmentation, or systemic distrust.

This profile does not presume misconduct.
It strengthens structural visibility.

---

## Purpose

This profile enhances the detection of:

- Narrative inconsistencies
- Decision asymmetries
- Procedural opacity
- Recurrent pattern distortions

It does not identify culpability.
It structures interpretive coherence under stress.

---

## Activation Context

The Institutional Crisis profile is intended for:

- Organizational governance breakdowns
- Public institutional controversies
- Escalating internal conflicts
- Whistleblower environments
- High-trust erosion contexts

---

## Configuration Parameters

When activated, this profile:

- Elevates pattern-recognition sensitivity
- Flags repetition loops and narrative inversions
- Requires expanded uncertainty logging
- Increases cross-document relational mapping
- Highlights temporal discontinuities

---

## Structural Safeguards

Under this profile:

- Interpretive inferences must remain explicitly marked
- Probabilistic indicators must be separated from factual layers
- No structural pattern may be labeled as intent
- Human oversight must remain documented

---

## Architectural Principle

Institutional instability amplifies interpretive noise.

The role of RPO under crisis conditions is not to decide,
but to stabilize coherence under stress.

Proof remains:

- Structured
- Traceable
- Context-aware
- Contestable

## Power Distortion Indicators

In high-instability environments, structural power asymmetries
may influence narrative construction.

This section defines non-accusatory indicators that increase
structural scrutiny without inferring intent.

### 1. Narrative Concentration

- Recurrent framing controlled by a limited number of actors
- Reduced plurality of documented perspectives
- Repetition of identical lexical constructs across sources

### 2. Asymmetrical Documentation Density

- Uneven archival depth between parties
- Selective preservation patterns
- Missing procedural trace segments

### 3. Temporal Compression or Expansion

- Sudden acceleration of decision sequences
- Delayed formalization of prior actions
- Retrospective justification layering

### 4. Reputational Pre-Framing

- Early character qualification preceding evidence review
- Implicit credibility weighting without formal basis

### 5. Institutional Silence Zones

- Absence of procedural response despite formal triggers
- Lack of traceable oversight escalation

---

These indicators do not establish misconduct.

They increase interpretive resolution
in environments where structural power may distort coherence.

All flagged signals remain:

- Contextual
- Probabilistic
- Explicitly reviewable
- Subject to human adjudication

---

## Epistemic Stress Index (ESI)

The Epistemic Stress Index measures the structural instability
of knowledge production within a contested institutional environment.

It does not assess truth.
It evaluates coherence pressure.

### Definition

Epistemic Stress occurs when:

- Interpretive coherence degrades
- Documentation asymmetry increases
- Narrative volatility accelerates
- Decision traceability weakens

### Core Variables

1. Coherence Deviation Rate (CDR)
   Variation in interpretive consistency across documented events.

2. Narrative Volatility Score (NVS)
   Frequency of framing shifts or lexical realignment over time.

3. Trace Integrity Ratio (TIR)
   Ratio between formal decisions and traceable procedural anchors.

4. Asymmetry Gradient (AG)
   Disparity in evidentiary density between actors.

### Index Behavior

Low ESI → Stable knowledge production  
Moderate ESI → Narrative tension, resolvable through audit  
High ESI → Systemic epistemic distortion risk  

### Interpretation Rule

The ESI does not indicate wrongdoing.

It signals environments where:

- Power may influence interpretive outcomes
- Oversight mechanisms require reinforcement
- Independent review becomes structurally advisable
